It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
It's ok though, my lack of lederhose is made up by the amount beer I can drink in the biergarten.
I ditched my crashed car and headed to Oktoberfest, because I’m too wettbewerbsfaehig to let Melhase have all the fun.
I got my hund and some gebaeck to cheer me up as I walked down the hauptstrasse.
As I walked down the hauptstrasse, I passed a building reminicent of Schloss Eltz, I pondered "That's an odd place for a Schloss."  
At this Schloss, there was a nice BMW waiting for me, but I decided to keep walking!

When I got closer, I realized it was a Flughafen so I booked a ticket to Berlin.
As I sat in my seat, I wondered how I could have confused a Flughafuen with a Schloss. Maybe if I would have gotten the Porche instead, the concussion wouldn't be so bad.
I reminded myself to go straigth to this particular ratskeller with an amazing biergarten once I landed in Berlin.  I can cure my concussion by getting drunk before noon. 
To get back to Oktoberfest, I decided to rent a Porsche to get back to the Haupstrasse quicker and ate an apfelkuchen on the way.
I turn the klimaanlage on and think what a great Oktoberfest it is going to be.
Hopefully the lederhose wont be to tight!
I would enjoy Oktoberfest more if my ears weren't ringing from listening to Rammstein too loud and if my neck didn't hurt from crashing the BMW.
We drove the porsche to the nearest schloss and bought some brot from the local baeckerei.
