It was nice and sunny day in Raesfeld. 
Until I crashed my BMW, while listening to Rammstein too loud. 
I was distracted looking at Mehlhase on Haupstrasse eating Brot and Bratwurst.
She was wearing Dirndl because of Oktoberfest.
Oh no! Its Oktoberfest and I forgot to wear my lederhose!
It's ok though, my lack of lederhose is made up by the amount beer I can drink in the biergarten.
I ditched my crashed car and headed to Oktoberfest, because Iâ€™m too wettbewerbsfaehig to let Melhase have all the fun.
I got my hund and some gebaeck to cheer me up as I walked down the hauptstrasse.
As I walked down the hauptstrasse, I passed a building reminicent of Schloss Eltz, I pondered "That's an odd place for a Schloss."  
At this Schloss, there was a nice BMW waiting for me, but I decided to keep walking!

When I got closer, I realized it was a Flughafen so I booked a ticket to Berlin.
As I sat in my seat, I wondered how I could have confused a Flughafuen with a Schloss. Maybe if I would have gotten the Porche instead, the concussion wouldn't be so bad.
I reminded myself to go straigth to this particular ratskeller with an amazing biergarten once I landed in Berlin.  I can cure my concussion by getting drunk before noon. 
To get back to Oktoberfest, I decided to rent a Porsche to get back to the Haupstrasse quicker and ate an apfelkuchen on the way.
I turn the klimaanlage on and think what a great Oktoberfest it is going to be.
Hopefully the lederhose wont be to tight!
I would enjoy Oktoberfest more if my ears weren't ringing from listening to Rammstein too loud and if my neck didn't hurt from crashing the BMW.
All I know is that I'm glad it wasn't the Porsche!
Hopefully once I get to the biergarten, a combination of beer and bratwurst will make me forget about my neck pain and crashed BMW.
Immediately upon arrival, I indulgently consumed not Sieben, not Acht, but Neun Paulaner Oktoberfest Biers!
